# Project: Refactor SEO Homework
![photo of application](screen-shot.png)
#
## Description
Improving an existing code without changing what the application does. The html file includes elements that are tagged as < div > and need to be named properly. The html file has a header, body, nav, section, article, aside, a footer and etc. In this project, I was required to name and place these elements in their respected spots. I also had to make sure that all h1, h2, and h3 elements were in sequential order.
#
## What does the application do?
When the html file is opened in the live server, I am then presented with a web browser containing the company's name, a navigation bar to guide me to certain areas of the web browser and, a body containing the company's work information and work benefits.
#
## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
